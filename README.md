# AGONLIGHT2
a z80 beastie

collection of things needed to get `t3x retro compiler` running on an `Agon Light 2` from Olimex.

_why?_

## starting with MOS 1.03

which is what we have just now.
(and I have no ZDI Zilog data cables, and I am not desperate enough to figure out how to cable one.)
(also, I have, and will not, use Windows to do _any_ of this. C'mon, it's damn near 2024.)

## The Compiler

[https://t3x.org/t3x/0/book.html](https://t3x.org/t3x/0/book.html) is the software to get running in this attempt.
It should be possible, as it __has already been ported to `CP/M2.2`.

and the code...
